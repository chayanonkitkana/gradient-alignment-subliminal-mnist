WORK IN PROGRESS: The manuscript and associated code are under active development and will be iterated on. The results, write-up, and code may change in the future versions.

This repository contains a working prototype experiment code for reproducing the results in a working paper "Sustained Gradient Alignment Mediates Subliminal Learning in a Multi-Step Setting: Evidence from MNIST Auxiliary Logit Distillation Experiment"

The working paper can be accessed here:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18228129

The experiment code is currently unoptimized. It takes around one hour on Google Colab standard free instance to run e1 and around 30 minuets to run e2.
