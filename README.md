WORK IN PROGRESS: The manuscript and associated code are under active development and will be iterated on. The results, write-up, and code may change in the future versions.

This repository contains a working prototype experiment code for reproducing the results in a working paper "Sustained Gradient Alignment Mediates Subliminal Learning in a Multi-Step Setting: Evidence from MNIST Auxiliary Logit Distillation Experiment"

The working paper can be accessed here:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18228129

The experiment code is currently unoptimized. Reproducing the figures in the paper requires approximately 1–2 hours per experiment on a standard free Google Colab runtime.
