WORK IN PROGRESS

This repository contains a working prototype experiment code for reproducing the results in a working paper "Sustained Gradient Alignment Mediates Subliminal Learning in a Multi-Step Setting: Evidence from MNIST Auxiliary Logit Distillation Experiment"

The experiment code is currently unoptimized. It takes around one hour on Google Colab standard free instance to run e1 and around 30 minuets to run e2.
